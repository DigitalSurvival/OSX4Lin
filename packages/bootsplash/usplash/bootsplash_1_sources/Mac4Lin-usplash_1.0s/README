This is my first attempt at a usplash theme.  It uses custom animation to get the feel of a mac osx box booting - with the osx spinner.  There are 4 different resolution images for use - 1024x768, 1280x1024, 1280x800, and 1440x900.  Not sure about getting the widescreen resolutions to work but the 4:3 resolutions work.  The default resolution is 1024x768.

You can change the code: <code>static int spinner_speed = 2;</code> to a number between 1 and 25 to throttle the speed at which the spinner spins.  There are 12 images in the spinner, so a value of 2 will make the spinner go round approximately once per second since the animation function gets called 25 times per second.  Of course a larger value will make it move slower.

THANKS
==================================================
A big thanks to the linux community and the authors of other usplash themes for which I learned from reading the code.  Also huge thanks to the theme developers as I would not have any graphics if it was not for them.

I am sorry I can't remember who in particular to thank for the insights into the code and the graphics.  If you email me I will most certainly give you credit.

QUICK INSTALL
==================================================
Included is the splash lib.  You can get running quickly by:

1.  make install
2.  reboot


QUICK BUILD AND INSTALLATION
==================================================
The make file will take care of building, installing and regenerating initrd so the new splash takes effect on reboot.

1.  make
2.  sudo make install
3.  reboot


MANUAL BUILD AND INSTALLATION
==================================================
You will need to appropriate libs and compiler to install.

1.  make
2.  copy macx-splash.so to your desired location
3.  update /etc/alternatives/usplash-artwork.so to point to macx-splash.so
4.  regenerate initrd
5.  reboot


**** Note:  after make and make install you can do "sudo make test" to see it without rebooting
