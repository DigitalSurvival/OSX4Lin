## You've found the OSX4Lin Project!

#### Introduction
OSX4Lin is a fork of Mac4Lin. It is currently being "developed" for use on Portage-based operating systems (Gentoo, Funtoo, Sabayon, etc). The primary desktop environment to be supported by OSX4Lin is XFCE, although support for other desktop environments might be implemented in the future.

#### The Background
In July, 2014 a man was attempting to update components in his wife's [13-inch, Mid 2010 MacBook Pro] (http://support.apple.com/kb/sp583) when he realized the [spiffy new SSD] (http://www.amazon.com/MZ-7PD256Z-840-Pro-Series-256GB-SATA/dp/B009PK2MVQ) he purchased was not recognized by the OSX install DVD. This bothered the man. He used his detective skills to see if the problem was with OSX or if the aging [Foxconn] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn) motherboard simply could not support the spiffy new SSD. He booted the operating system of choice: [Gentoo Linux] (http://www.gentoo.org/). A smile of joy widened across his lips when /dev/sda appeared. At that moment the man made a choice. Although OSX looks beautiful, it was not worth the unpractical hassle of trying to re-install OSX on the "non-identifiable" SSD.

In a flash [Gentoo] (http://www.gentoo.org/) emerged. The man took satisfaction in his work knowing his wife could be more [productive] (http://www.digitalsurvival.us/) while using her little computer. You see, the little rainbow color wheel had delayed her for long portions of time. After the [keyboard hot keys] (http://packages.gentoo.org/package/app-laptop/pommed) were configured the man presented the computer to his lovely bride. She looked it over and was quite pleased with how fast the system operated. There was, however, one problem that the man (in all his wisdom) did not foresee: his wife did not know how to use an interface without a dock! She loved how much faster her 'new' computer was, but she was much more comfortable using her "Mac computer." With much determination the man set out to do whatever it would take in order to fix his wife's dilemma. He [scoured] (https://duckduckgo.com/) the vast regions of the internet for days and had no great victories in finding a suitable OSX skin and a well mannered dock for XFCE. It was at that moment [OSX4Lin] (https://github.com/DigitalSurvival/OSX4Lin) was born.

### ChangeLog

####January 28th, 2015
* Researching possibly implementing OSX4Lin into the gnome desktop environments using Macbuntu as a base.

#### July 14th, 2014
* Removed Firefox skins
* Removed SongBird skins. SongBird left Linux back in 2010; Mac4Lin is showing you it's age...

#### Project History
* Not much information is available in the Mac4Lin's project history, however there were two names that were connected with the project:
